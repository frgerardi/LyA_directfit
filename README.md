# LyA_directfit

This code is mainly based on the use of [Vega](https://github.com/andreicuceu/vega), previously developed by A.Cuceu, and [Cobaya](https://github.com/CobayaSampler/cobaya). In particular, the workflow runs a slightly different version of Vega, where all amendments are included within the [vega/vega_interface_mod.py](https://github.com/frgerardi/LyA_directfit/blob/main/vega/vega_interface_mod.py) module
